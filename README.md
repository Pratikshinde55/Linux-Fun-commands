"Exploring the Fun Side of Linux: A Journey Through Entertaining Terminal Commands"

ðŸŒŸsst-up: i used aws cloud "amazon linux" ami for instance , in this i run linux commands.

Install Required Packages:

If any of the fun commands are not already installed on our Amazon Linux instance, we can use the package manager yum to install them. For example,
to install cowsay, we can use:

      # yum install cowsay

âš¡To run cowsay with a custom message:

      #cowsay "hey Good moring today is 4 april"

âš¡To display a rainbow-colored text:

for this need install package:lolcat: Since lolcat is a Ruby gem, we can install it via RubyGems:
      
      #sudo yum install ruby
      #sudo gem install lolcat

command:

     #echo "Hi, I am pratik shinde from DevOps world !!!"  | lolcat
